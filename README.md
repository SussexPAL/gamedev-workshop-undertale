# TODO
Immediate (refine week 1 stuff):
- Quick git tutorial (download model project) 
- Recolor placeholder ground texture using GradientTexture2D
- Refactor scene tree (set rigidbody/statidbody as parent node. Already done on github repo.)
- Vectorize the movement input (and normalize it)
- Improve player movement (replace positional movement for either scripted (CharacterBody move_and_slide) or simulated (rigidBody add_force))
- Add @export variable for movement speed

Future (completed on model project):
- Spritesheet animation - AnimatedSprite vs AnimationPlayer/AnimationTree
- `[E]` to interact - Message Bus pattern vs direct function calls
- Misc. Overworld features for fun (smooth camera, camera zoom, player rotation, NPC pulse on interact, floaty text) 

# Log
## Week 1
- Explained the scene tree and nodes
- Used the input map to implement WASD movement
- Covered basic movement by altering `position.x` and `position.x`
- Added collision, still in progress

## Week 2
- Studied and refined features from week 1; we will cover these first
-
